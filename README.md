# Community Outreach Technology Loan API

Fastify/TypeScript API for tenant-scoped outreach centers, devices, loans, loan reasons, and maintenance. JSON fields use camelCase; a MySQL repository maps them to snake_case columns.

## Run

```sh
npm install
copy .env.example .env
npm run dev
```

All `/v1` endpoints except the development token endpoint require `Authorization: Bearer <JWT>`. Successful resource responses use `{ "data": ... }`. Paginated responses also contain `{ "page": { "limit": 25, "nextCursor": null } }`. Errors use `{ "error": string, "requestId": string }` and include validation details when applicable.

Protected endpoints can return `400` for invalid input, `401` for missing or invalid authentication, `403` for insufficient permissions, and `500` for unexpected errors. Resource-specific `404` and `409` responses are noted below.

## Health

### GET `/health`

- Use case: Check basic process health.
- Authentication: None.
- Required role: None.
- Request: No path parameters, query parameters, or body.

curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:3020/v1/dev/token -H "content-type: application/json" -d "{\"tenantId\":\"acme-it\"}"
```

## Transaction and schema TODOs

- A production MySQL repository must wrap checkout, return, maintenance opening, and maintenance resolution in transactions.
- A dedicated device-event table is required to record transfers, manual status changes, and edits independently of loans and maintenance.
- Consider adding `is_active` to `loan_reasons` if reasons need to be retired without deletion.
- Add a separate readiness endpoint or check for MySQL connectivity.
